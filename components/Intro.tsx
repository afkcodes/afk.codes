          <p>Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ashish! I'm a developer, an explorer, a music buff, and a home cook</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Currently, I'm working on all things web at Rakuten India (Bengaluru). I kicked off my
            journey in 2019 as a software engineer, starting with JavaScript game development.

          <p>
            Hailing from Bokaro, Jharkhand, India, I find joy in creating websites and hybrid apps.
            I groove to the beats of 90s and early 2000s Bollywood tunes. Moreover, I like to
            explore my culinary skills in the kitchen, whipping up delightful dishes whenever the
            opportunity arises.
