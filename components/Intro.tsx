            Hey, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ashish! I wear many hatsâ€”I'm a developer, an explorer, a music buff, and a
            home cook
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Currently, I'm working on all things web-related at Rakuten India in Bengaluru. I kicked
            off my journey in 2019 as a software engineer, starting with JavaScript game
            development.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Originally from Bokaro, Jharkhand, India, I enjoy crafting websites and mobile apps.
            While coding, I groove to the beats of 90s and early 2000s Bollywood tunes.
            Additionally, I experiment in the kitchen, cooking up some delicious dishes whenever I
            get the chance.
